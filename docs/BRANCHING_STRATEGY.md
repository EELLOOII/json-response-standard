# Branching Strategy and CI/CD Integration

## Overview
This repository uses a **staging-first** branching strategy to ensure all changes are properly tested before reaching production.

## Branch Structure

```
main (production)
├── staging (integration/testing)
│   ├── feature/user-auth
│   ├── feature/api-v2
│   └── hotfix/critical-bug
└── develop (development)
```

## Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `staging` or `develop`
2. Implement changes
3. Create Pull Request to `staging`
4. CI/CD runs automatically on PR
5. After review and approval, merge to `staging`

### 2. Staging Integration
1. Changes automatically deployed to staging environment
2. Integration testing occurs
3. QA validation happens
4. Bug fixes go through same process

### 3. Production Release
1. Create Pull Request from `staging` to `main`
2. Final review and approval
3. Merge to `main` triggers production deployment
4. Release notes generated automatically

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### Staging Branch
- **Triggers**: Push to staging, PRs to staging
- **Tests**: Full test suite (JavaScript, Python, PHP)
- **Environment**: Auto-deploy to staging environment
- **Deployment**: Automatic on successful tests
- **Notifications**: Slack notifications for deployment status

### Main Branch
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PRs to main
- **Tests**: Full test suite + additional production checks
- **Environment**: Production deployment
- **Deployment**: Manual approval required
- **Notifications**: Email + Slack for production deployments

## Environment Configuration

### Staging Environment
- **URL**: https://staging.json-response-standard.example.com
- **Features**: Experimental features enabled
- **Logging**: Debug level logging
- **Validation**: Relaxed validation for testing

### Production Environment
- **URL**: https://json-response-standard.example.com
- **Features**: Only stable features
- **Logging**: Error level logging
- **Validation**: Strict validation

## Benefits

1. **Early Integration Testing**: Catch conflicts early in staging
2. **Reduced Production Risk**: All changes tested in staging first
3. **Faster Feedback**: Immediate deployment to staging for testing
4. **Better Collaboration**: Clear integration point for all contributors
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing at every level

## Best Practices

1. **Always merge to staging first** before production
2. **Test thoroughly in staging** before creating PR to main
3. **Keep staging branch stable** - it's shared by all contributors
4. **Use feature flags** for experimental features
5. **Monitor staging deployments** for issues

## Commands

### For Contributors
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature staging

# Push and create PR to staging
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR to staging via GitHub UI

# After staging testing, create PR to main
# Create PR from staging to main via GitHub UI
```

### For Maintainers
```bash
# Deploy to staging (automatic on merge)
git checkout staging
git merge feature/my-feature

# Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge staging
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

- **Staging Health Check**: Automated every 5 minutes
- **Deployment Notifications**: Slack #staging-deployments
- **Error Monitoring**: Automatic error reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking
